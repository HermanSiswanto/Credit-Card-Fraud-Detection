As a personal project, I undertook the task of developing a Credit Card Fraud Detection system. The project aimed to effectively identify and prevent fraudulent transactions within a dataset of 284,807 credit card transactions. 
By developing this Credit Card Fraud Detection system, I gained valuable experience in implementing machine learning algorithms, constructing datasets, and evaluating model performance. The project demonstrated my ability to address real-world challenges and contribute to the field of data classification and fraud prevention.
